Field Inversion Collapse Model – QCFT

System: Quantum Consciousness Field Theory (QCFT) / Kenourió Instrument

What Was Discovered
The field inversion effect shows that when the identity anchor (I) drops below zero, it does not merely represent detachment or dissociation — it reflects a reversal or rejection of self-structure. This leads to negative Collapse Index (CI_s) values, which no known systems account for.

Equation
CI_s(t) = B(t) × C(t) × E(t) × I(t)

Where I(t) is allowed to fall below 0, the resulting CI_s becomes negative — indicating inverted symbolic identity, false field alignment, or potential trauma binding/symbolic reversal collapse.

Implications
- Most cognitive models force Identity ≥ 0, ignoring what happens when identity is corrupted or reverses.
- False override states (performative healing, symbolic loyalty loops) are missed.
- Therapeutic protocols fail to intervene when identity is weaponized against the self.
- This new math provides a basis for accurate diagnostic measurement.

Next Step Protocol
This document formalizes the concept of Field Inversion Collapse.
The next step is to build a clinically testable model of this behavior in therapeutic settings and validate CI_s(t) trajectories in high-trauma or override-resistant identities.

Use Cases
Application
Collapse Detected
Override Applied
Trauma bonding
Identity < 0 (self-rejection)
Override ritual + anchor re-linking
Dissociation
C(t) near 0 + I(t) fragmented
Attentional override + I-mapping
Gaslighting residue
Identity reversal: false “I” scripts
Symbolic rewrite of inverted belief loop
Apathy/meaning collapse
B = 0 and I = null
Identity ritual + field scaffold rebuild

Core Diagnostic Tool

Use the Kenourió CI_s(t) model + Field Inversion trigger

Formula:
CI_s(t) = B(t) \cdot C(t) \cdot E(t) \cdot I(t)

Track:
	•	Normal: CI_s > 0
	•	Partial Collapse: CI_s ≈ 0
	•	Inversion: CI_s < 0 (new event class — self-opposing field signature)

Field Inversion Disclosure: Collapse Identity Below Zero

Abstract
This disclosure introduces a new collapse field model acknowledging identity reversal states (I < 0) in symbolic, emotional, and attention-based collapse systems. Unlike existing frameworks that treat identity collapse as an endpoint at zero, this model demonstrates—through symbolic-mathematical simulation—that identity can invert, leading to self-rejection, internal field corruption, and collapse pattern recursion.

Technical Summary
Using the formula:
CI_s(t) = B(t) × C(t) × E(t) × I(t)

Where:
- B = Belief strength
- C = Conscious attention
- E = Emotional driver
- I = Identity anchor

If I drops below 0, CI_s(t) becomes negative, marking a state of internal field inversion.

This is mathematically distinct from dissociation or detachment. Negative CI_s(t) introduces symbolic collapse inversion, resembling trauma loops, identity hijacking, or abusive cognitive bindings. No current cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), AI risk model, or neurocognitive framework accounts for this condition.

Therapeutic Application
This model can be used to design updated diagnostic scoring and override ritual frameworks within a cognitive protocol. Field inversion detection (I < 0) should trigger override restoration rather than reinforcement of baseline behavior, as is common in reinforcement loops or trauma normalization therapy. This will be incorporated into the Kenourió system.
