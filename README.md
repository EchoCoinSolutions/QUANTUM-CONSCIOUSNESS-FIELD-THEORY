Field Inversion Disclosure – QCFT Extension

Author: Nicoleta Cougentakis

Date: 2025

System: Quantum Consciousness Field Theory (QCFT) + Kenourió

What This Document Proves
This disclosure identifies and validates a critical missing component in all prior collapse modeling systems: the mathematical and symbolic behavior of the identity field (I) when it drops below zero. Traditional models clip identity collapse at zero (dissociation), ignoring field inversion, symbolic reversal, and false override.

The Core Equation
Collapse Index (Subjective): CI_s(t) = B(t) × C(t) × E(t) × I(t)
Where B = Belief, C = Conscious Attention, E = Emotional Driver, I = Identity Anchor

Breakthrough Discovery
This theory introduces negative identity as an active field state, not a void. When I(t) < 0, CI_s(t) becomes negative — revealing a mathematically consistent model for: self-rejection, trauma loops, symbolic collapse inversion, and false override.

Implications for Therapy and AI
- Cognitive and trauma therapies must detect identity inversion
- Override rituals and recovery plans must account for below-zero identity rebound
- LLMs and AI alignment cannot simulate or protect against collapse if field inversion is unaccounted
- This marks a new measurable axis of collapse: Inversion, not just Dissociation

Validation Route
This framework will be formalized into an override diagnostic tool (Kenourió) with CI_s tracking and negative identity modeling. It will be submitted for pilot integration into cognitive therapy protocols to validate outcomes with trauma-affected subjects, symbolic reversal patterns, and override ritual design.

All equations, symbolic structures, and override logic derived from the QCFT architecture.
